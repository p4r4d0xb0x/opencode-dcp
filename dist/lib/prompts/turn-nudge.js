Evaluate the conversation for compressible ranges.

If any range is cleanly closed and unlikely to be needed again, use the compress tool on it.
If direction has shifted, compress earlier ranges that are now less relevant.

Prefer small, closed-range compressions over one broad compression.
The goal is to filter noise and distill key information so context accumulation stays under control.
Keep active context uncompressed.
